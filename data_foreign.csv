"GMA News","PH",2023-02-13,168,"Amending the 1987 Constitution to allow 100% foreign ownership of land and public industries would put the country’s national security at great risk, lawyer and Bayan Muna chairperson Neri Colmenares said Monday. “This [amendment to allow foreigners to own resources here] is a national security issue. Paano kung bilhin ng China lahat ng beachheads diyan sa Palawan o Mindoro? Pag sila na ang may-ari niyan, puede na sila mag landing diyan,” Colmenares said. Colmenares said that it is also a question of food security, and that opening land to foreign ownership could decimate agricultural lands. “Kung gusto nilang gawing golf course ‘yun, paano na ang mga palayan natin? Saan ka pa magtatanim ng palay at iba ang pangangailangang pagkain?” Colmenares said. But for Iloilo Representative Lorenz Defensor, opening the Constitution to majority foreign ownership is not a sellout move. “Since they are only allowed to invest at 40%, there is no investor confidence. Besides, amending the economic provisions does not automatically mean they will have 100%,” Defensor said. “It only means Congress will pass a law that would make it 50%-50%, or 70%-30% with the majority stake belonging to any qualified investors,” Defensor added.","https://www.facebook.com/116724526976/posts/10161610091246977"

En Colombia, casi 40 mil personas han fallecido por la enfermedad y 1,5 millones la han padecido. Este año, ha sido común escuchar sobre cuarentenas estrictas y medidas de bioseguridad, al igual que historias de quienes han vivido el sufrimiento por el virus. El personal de salud, la primera línea, se tuvo que acoplar en cuestión de horas a la cruda realidad. Algo que empezó en China se expandió rápidamente. Ellos, nuestros héroes, se han convertido en el bastión para sobrevivir. ¿Quién iba a pensar que el 2020 iba a estar marcado por una pandemia? La incertidumbre se apoderó de cada uno de nosotros. Los gobiernos adoptaron medidas y nuestra vida dio un giro de 180 grados. Los planes de aquella víspera de Año Nuevo quedaron, para muchos, en el papel. Otros tantos los reacomodaron en el camino. Los abrazos, besos y saludos se eliminaron por completo durante un tiempo. Los cumpleaños se celebraron por videollamadas y en las casas se tuvieron que acoplar espacios para trabajar. El desempleo, la pobreza y la brecha de desigualdad social se profundizaron. La economía mundial ha tenido un impacto del que no se podrá remediar pronto; el medioambiente ha sido afectado aún más por el aumento en la contaminación de plásticos de un solo uso derivados de los elementos de protección, y la nueva generación tuvo que educarse desde sus hogares ¿Cuántas amistades dejaron de crearse? Hoy, aunque la carrera por la vacuna es prometedora, parece que pasará todavía mucho tiempo antes de declarar victoria. La batalla científica apenas comienza y los problemas sociales se incrementan.
